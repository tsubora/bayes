# Stat319/Stat739: Introduction to Bayesian Inference

This is the course page of our class, where I will be uploading the lecture notes.
I'm still working to iron out small issues. I plan to have this webpage to be up and running soon.
During the semester, I'll be adding lecture notes as we cover more material.
